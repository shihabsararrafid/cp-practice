not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper.\nHe felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself.\n\"Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\" he reflceted, on the steps.\n\"And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem?\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once.\nHe was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nBut tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar.\nThere was no vodka.\nRakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing.\nHe had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything.\nHe was of an uneasy and envious temper.\nHe was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit.\nNeither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited.\nThey were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.\nThe other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also.\nThe Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests.\nHe was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face.\nHe bowed to his guests in silence.\nBut this time they approaced to receive his blessing.\nMiusov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute.\nBut Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\"We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone.\n\"Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch.\nHe felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason.\nIn the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping...\nin fact, quite unseamly...\nas\" -- he glanced at the monks -- \"your reverance is, no doubt, already aware.\nAnd therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets.\nIn brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later.\nHe asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\"\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered.\nHe fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\"I sincerly deplore his absence.\nPerhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him.\nPray be seated, gentlemen.\"\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud.\nAll bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank.\nNot that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps.\nBut still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner.\nYet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short.\nHe suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \"Why do you hate so and so, so much?\" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \"I'll tell you.\nHe has done me no harm.\nBut I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\"\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment.\nHis eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\"Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\" he decided.\nHis predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \"Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now.\nSo let me shame them for all I am worht.\nI will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\"\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's.\nIn the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes.\nHe appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table.\nStanding in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face.\n\"They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen.\nMiusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage.\nAll the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\"No!\nthis I cannot endure!\" he cried.\n\"I absolutly cannot!\nand...\nI certainly cannot!\"\n\nThe blood rushed to his head.\nHe positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\"What is it he cannot?\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \"that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot?\nYour reverence, am I to come in or not?\nWill you recieve me as your guest?\"\n\n\"You are welcome with all my heart,\" answerred the Superior.\n\"Gentlemen!\" he added, \"I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\"\n\n\"No, no, it is impossible!\" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\"Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop.\nThat is why I came.\nI will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now.\nIf you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.\nYou stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion.\nThat's right, isn't it, von Sohn?\nHere's von Sohn.\nHow are you, von Sohn?\"\n\n\"Do you mean me?\" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\"Of course I mean you,\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch.\n\"Who else?\nThe Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\"\n\n\"But I am not von Sohn either.\nI am Maximov.\"\n\n\"No, you are von Sohn.\nYour reverence, do you know who von Sohn was?\nIt was a famos murder case.\nSo this is that very von Solin.\nHe has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\"\n\n\"What is happening?\nWhat's this?\" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\"Let us go,\" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\"No, excuse me,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room.\n\"Allow me to finis.\nThere in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\nMiusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his words, but I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse!\nThat's right, isn't it, von Sohn?\nAllow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind.\nYes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.\nI came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind.\nMy son, Alexey, is here, being saved.\nI am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care.\nWhile I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence.\nYou know how things are with us?\nAs a thing falls, so it lies.\nAs a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever.\nNot a bit of it!\nI want to get up again.\nHoly Father, I am indignent with you.\nConfession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud.\nCan it be right to confess aloud?\nIt was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old.\nBut how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that...\nwell, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal!\nNo, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say....\natt the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\"\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot.\nBut the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander.\nHe was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders.\nAnd, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\"How disgraveful!\" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" said the Father Superior.\n\"It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me.\nAnd hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\"Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases!\nOld phrasses and old gestures.\nThe old lies and formal prostratoins.\nWe know all about them.\nA kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers.\nI don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth.\nBut the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud!\nFather monks, why do you fast?\nWhy do you expect reward in heaven for that?\nWhy, for reward like that I will come and fast too!\nI can talk sense, too, Father Superior.\nWhat have they got here?\" He went up to the table.\n\"Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers.\nFie, fie, fathers!\nThat is something beyond gudgeon.\nLook at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he!\nAnd who has provided it all?\nThe Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer!\nYou bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\"\n\n\"This is too disgraceful!\" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent.\nMiusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\"Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch!\nI am not coming to see you again.\nYou may beg me on your knees, I shan't come.\nI sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me.\nHe he he!\nNo, I'll say no more.\nI am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling.\n\"This monastery has played a great part in my life!\nIt has cost me many bitter tears.\nYou used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me.\nYou cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place.\nEnough, fathers!\nThis is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways.\nNeither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\"\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.\nBut he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself.\nHe was so touched he was almost weeping.\nBut at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\"It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut!\nBethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.\nBethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go.\nBut I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority.\nIvan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me.\nVon Sohn, what have you to stay for?\nCome and see me now in the town.\nIt is fun there.\nIt is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha.\nWe will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it....\nI've cloudberry wyne.\nHey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\"Alexey!\" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him.\n\"You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\"\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense.\nMeanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha.\nBut at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode.\nMaximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage.\nHe ran up, panting, afraid of being too late.\nRakitin and Alyosha saw him runing.\nHe was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in.\n\"I am going with you!\n\" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face.\n\"Take me, too.\"\n\n\"There!\" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted.\n\"Did I not say he waz von Sohn.\nIt iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead.\nWhy, how did you tear yourself away?\nWhat did you von Sohn there?\nAnd how could you get away from the dinner?\nYou must be a brazen-faced fellow!\nI am that myself, but I am surprized at you, brother!\nJump in, jump in!\nLet him pass, Ivan.\nIt will be fun.\nHe can lie somwhere at our feet.\nWill you lie at our feet, von Sohn?\nOr perch on the box with the coachman.\nSkipp on to the box, von Sohn!\"\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying.\nIt was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\"Drive on!\" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\"Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot?\nWhy did you do that?\" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away.\nIvan made no reply.\n\n\"Well, you are a fellow,\" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \"Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines.\nYou urged it, you approvved of it.\nWhy are you angry now?\"\n\n\"You've talked rot enough.\nYou might rest a bit now,\" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\"A drop of brandy would be nice now,\" he observd sententiosly, but Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\"You shall have some, too, when we get home.\"\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\"But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\"\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared
